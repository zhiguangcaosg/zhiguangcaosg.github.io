**Who am I?**
<br>

<p align="justify">I am a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="http://rcv.kaist.ac.kr"><b>RCV Lab</b></a>. at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) under the advisement of Prof.In So Kweon. My research interests are in the areas of machine learning and computer vision, with a focus on multi-modal machine learning (audio-visual), deep learning and sports video analysis.</p>

<br />

<p align="justify">Before I started to my Ph.D. at KAIST, I was a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/schaefer-school-engineering-science/departments/computer-science"><b>Stevens Institute of Technology</b></a>  under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.stevens.edu/~mordohai/index.html"><b>Prof. Philippos Mordohai</b></a>. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from KAIST and I also received my Master's Degree from the Electrical Engineering Department of KAIST.</p>
