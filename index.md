<h3 style="margin-bottom:0px;padding-top:20px;">About Me</h3> <br>

<p align="justify">I am currently a Research Assistant Professor with the Department of Industrial Systems Engineering and Management (ISEM), National University of Singapore (NUS). I got the PhD from Interdisciplinary Graduate School & School of Computer Science and Engineering,  and the M.Sc from School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. I got the B.Eng in Automation from Guangdong University of Technology (GDUT), China. I hold a position of Research Fellow and Program Leader with the BMW@NTU Future Mobility Lab after PhD graduation.</p>
<!-- and I also hold an Associate Professor position with GDUT for a short period-->

<h3 style="margin-bottom:-8px;padding-top:20px;">Research Interests</h3> <br>
<p align="justify">Recently, I focus on exploiting Deep (Reinforcement) Learning to solve Combinatorial Opitimization Problems (<font color="#0000E3"><b>DRL4COP</b></font>), such as Vehicel Routing Problem, Job Shop Scheduling Problem, Bin Packing Problem, Constraint Satisfaction Problem, and (Mixed) Integer Programming Problem. It is a cutting-edge topic for both AI and Operations Research, quite interesting yet challenging. Welcome to use our <a href="https://zhiguangcaosg.github.io/publications/"  target="_blank"> <font color="#FF0000"><b>CODE</b> </font></a>.
