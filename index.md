<h3 style="margin-bottom:0px;padding-top:20px;">About Me</h3> <br>

<p align="justify">I am currently a Scientist with the Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology (SIMTech), Agency for Science Technology and Research (A*STAR). Previously, I was a Research Assistant Professor with the Department of Industrial Systems Engineering and Management, National University of Singapore (NUS), and a Research Fellow with the BMW@NTU Future Mobility Lab, Nanyang Technological University (NTU). I received the PhD from Interdisciplinary Graduate School & School of Computer Science and Engineering, and the M.Sc from School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, NTU. I received the B.Eng in Automation from Guangdong University of Technology (GDUT), China. </p>
<!-- and I also hold an Associate Professor position with GDUT for a short period-->

<h3 style="margin-bottom:-8px;padding-top:20px;">Research Interests</h3> <br>
<p align="justify">Recently, my interests focus on <font color="#0000E3"><b>Learning for Optimization (L4Opt)</b></font>, also known as <font color="#47A7F7"><b>Learning to Optimize (L2O)</b></font> and closely related to <font color="#47A7F7"><b>Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO)</b></font>, where we exploit Deep (Reinforcement) Learning to solve the classic Combinatorial Optimization Problems (such as Vehicle Routing Problem, Job Shop Scheduling Problem and Bin Packing Problem), Constraint Satisfaction Problem, and Integer Programming Problem. It is a hot topic for both AI and Operations Research, quite interesting yet challenging. Welcome to use our <a href="https://zhiguangcaosg.github.io/publications/"  target="_blank"> <font color="#FF0000"><b>CODE</b> </font></a> and reach out for collaboration.
